                Conceal is an open source community project, which means that there is no company behind it. This project is
                supported by the community, meaning there is no stable, full-time team and no physical headquarters from which
                the projects runs its operations. The advantage here is that anyone can propose changes or improvements to the
                blockchain, and, if the suggestion is voted by a majority of people, the changes are then implemented. This
                project is intended to be a community project not a commercial product and relies on volunteers availibility.
